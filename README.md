# CSCE-121

This is an overview of all of the assignments I have completed in CSCE 121 (Intro to Program Design & Concepts), the introductory C++ class at TAMU.

Currently this is private apart from the first HW assignment to prevent TAMU honor code violations while I am currently taking the course.
